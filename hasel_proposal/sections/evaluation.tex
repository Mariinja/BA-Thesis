% Your research work needs to be evaluated and you have to plan that ahead of time. You need to consider which kind of evaluation or validation to run for showing that you achieved your goals, be it an empirical study, a case-study based validation, a controlled user study, etc. In this section you should layout which experiments you plan, how they will look like and what you will validate with them.
