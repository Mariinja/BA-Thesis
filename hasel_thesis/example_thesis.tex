\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Importance of breaks}
- why do we need breaks
- How does it influence knowledge workers
- Examples of papers which have shown breaks are important
\section{Good / Effective of breaks}
 - Definition of a break
 - what is a good break what is a bad break?
 - How can we influence breaks (timing, duration and activities)
    - show paper with different activities and show that it is important how to spend break time

 - what is already done in relation to breaks?
    - speak about google tool, activity study etc.

 - show there is not tool incorporating all 3 aspects
 - Explain the goal and approach of this thesis

\section{Timing of breaks}
- what have other studies already shown
- what is their approach
- what can I learn in finding good time slots for breaks
- Are there different types of people with different timing breaks
- What are the factors influencing the timing? (input variables?)

\section{Duration of the break}
- what have other studies already shown
- what is their approach
- what can I learn in finding good time slots for breaks
- Are there different types of people with different timing breaks
- What are the factors influencing the duration? (input variables?)
- Is it correlated with the timing?

\section{Activity during the break}
- what have other studies already shown
- what is their approach
- Are there overall good activities? or is it personal
- Are there different types of people with different needs for activities?
- What are the factors influencing the activities? (input variables?)
