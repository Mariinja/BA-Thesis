abstract = {This paper analyzes how a supplier can formulate the terms of a quantity discount pricing schedule. Assuming a single incremental discount system, a model is developed from which an algorithm is derived for an optimal discount schedule. The cases are investigated in which both the discount rate and the break point are unknown and either one is prescribed. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the algorithm developed.}
